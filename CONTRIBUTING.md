Contributing
============

We love pull requests. Here are some tips to make both your and our experience smoother.

* Make a fork of the repository.
* Create a feature branch on top of develop branch and commit your changes.
	* If you already contributed in the past, make sure you synchronize with upstream before creating feature branch. This is to avoid merge conflicts.
* If it took you longer to develop a feature, synchronize with upstream and rebase your feature branch. We will always ask you to do that before merging.
* Test your changes by running `go test -cover`, push to your fork and submit a pull request.
* If you plan a larger task, start off by [creating an issue](https://github.com/assertgo/assert/issues), so we can discuss it.

Warning
-------

We love pull requests, but if you do too many of them over time and we feel like your coding style matches ours, we may ask you to join the organization. It's still your decision to accept the invitation, but you have been warned.
